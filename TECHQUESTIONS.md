1. I have spent 6 hours on this task. If I had more time I would add pagination or infinite scroll. The ability to create account in order to make a favourites list.
2. In terms of React I would say the most useful features added (not that recent) are the hooks which allow to simplify the process and make the code more readable.
3. I would use browser developer tools, performance tab in particular to record and assess the actions, unfortunately I don’t have too much experience with it yet.
4. First thing that comes to my mind is covers, whenever there’s no cover it sends a default one which is just a pixel which I have to change to a custom default.
